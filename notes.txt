I want to make a program that basically
- Goes into each of my AWS bots folders
- Checks the pybot.py file to get the base
- Asks the user what value to use for said base, or uses a previously chosen value
- Goes into the config file and updates the funds value

I think this will be best done in python.
I think I will copy the .py file to the pybots folder, like ~/pybots/set_funds.py.
    - Then when I run it I can check for bots in my current dir
